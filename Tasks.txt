- show release version in .gitmeta (r3) and .gitmeta-cid (r2)
- bug fix: create git hook not stuck anymore (now creating from file instead of cat eof)
- cid storing stable ; geth integration copyright commit's cid

- .gitmeta: also display the current folder, as folderstamp does and as .gitmeta already does for branch
- init.sh: complete the ETH commit signing feature! (author eth account + commit cid signature -> .gitmeta!)

-? issue/bug: gitmeta-cid supports only files that don't have spaces/special characters

- before going on the next tasks: make this project in the "pla-woke-license", preventing use in projects related to ppl like Elon Musk; GPT should help write it in a conciser manner

- https://github.com/gitcnd/git-meta.git: merge the latest commits /media/daniella/B/git/nerdy DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/to-merge

- init.sh: use /hooks folder rather than hardwriting!

- settings: option to run folderstamp on every commit

- init.sh: if no .git repo present, init using 01

- test on Termux

- "git restore" should also restore file timestamps! (same for git checkout)
01 git-meta endgame: parse .git-meta and find tree files on it on every commit, then apply timestamps on checkout!

- Better calc of each contributors' added lines/code. As seen here: https://github.com/01VCS/git-meta/graphs/contributors. So, make better credit commits, with all automatic code, attributed to each author, from the original gist.
