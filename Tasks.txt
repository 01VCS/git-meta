- before going on the next tasks: make this project in the pla-woke-license, preventing use in projects related to ppl like Elon Musk; GPT should help write it in a conciser manner

- .gitmeta: also display the current folder, as folderstamp does and as .gitmeta already does for branch
- init.sh: complete the ETH commit signing feature! (author eth account + commit cid signature -> .gitmeta!)

- init.sh: use /hooks folder rather than hardwriting!

- settings: option to run folderstamp on every commit

- init.sh: if no .git repo present, init using 01

- test on Termux

- "git restore" should also restore file timestamps! (same for git checkout)
01 git-meta endgame: parse .git-meta and find tree files on it on every commit, then apply timestamps on checkout!
