- bug fix issue of every 2nd commit modifying meta files which was enabling useless commits

- local (repo) or global (home folder) settings.json, containing option to run folderstamp on every commit (deactivated by default) ; global settings overhide repo settings when committing
- show release version in .gitmeta (r3) and .gitmeta-cid (r2)
- .gitmeta: also display the current folder, as folderstamp does and as .gitmeta already does for branch

- in the first commit at /media/daniella/B/git/nerdy DAOs/FilePeace/file-protection-standards, .gitmeta didn't recognize .folderstamp files and .gitmeta-cid did but as .gitmeta it didn't recognize "Untitled Document" too!

- ethereal integration copyright commit's cid
- init.sh: complete the ETH commit signing (but replace geth to ethereal) feature! (author eth account + commit cid signature -> .gitmeta!)

- new feature: eth-post on every commit (only post diff of files, serialized)

- before going on the next tasks: make this project in the "pla-woke-license", preventing use in projects related to ppl like Elon Musk; GPT+Bard should help write it in a conciser manner

- https://github.com/gitcnd/git-meta.git: merge the latest commits /media/daniella/B/git/nerdy DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/to-merge

-? init.sh: use /hooks folder rather than hardwriting!

- init.sh: if no .git repo present, init using 01

- test on Termux

- detect if the repo's disk is incompatible with symlinks, so use cp instead of ln

- 01 git-meta endgame: parse .git-meta and find tree files on it on every commit, then apply timestamps on checkout! - "git restore" should also restore file timestamps! (same for git checkout)

- Better calc of each contributors' added lines/code. As seen here: https://github.com/01VCS/git-meta/graphs/contributors. So, make better credit commits, with all automatic code, attributed to each author, from the original gist.
