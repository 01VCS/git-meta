About pre-commit's line 43: I want it to get the repo's first remote's URL.

Get the first remote's URL at line 12, store it using line 43 inspired about same way line 42 does!






To achieve the task of getting the repository's first remote URL and storing it in a similar manner as done in line 42 of the [pre-commit](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#18%2C36-18%2C36) script, you can use the `git remote get-url` command. This command retrieves the URL for a specific remote. Since you're interested in the first remote's URL, you can use `git remote` to list the remotes and then use `head -n 1` to select the first one. Here's how you can integrate this into line 12 and then store it using a method inspired by line 43:

```shell:pre-commit
12|first_remote_url=$(git remote | head -n 1 | xargs git remote get-url)
```

And then, to store it in a similar way as line 42 does, you can add the following line right after line 42:

```shell:pre-commit
43|echo "Remote URL: $first_remote_url" >> .gitmeta
```

This will append the first remote's URL to the `.gitmeta` file, following the format established for other metadata entries.







Please, based on above, I need another, but to happen before of Remote URL: Remote Name!




To add the repository's first remote name before the remote URL in the [.gitmeta](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/.gitmeta#1%2C1-1%2C1) file, you can insert the following line right before line 43 in the [pre-commit](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#19%2C36-19%2C36) script:

```shell:pre-commit
42|echo "Remote Name: $(git remote | head -n 1)" >> .gitmeta
```





This isn't exactly how it previously happened. I want a variable on line 9, and get it on line 44.









To achieve your request, you can define a variable for the first remote's name at line 9 in the [pre-commit](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit.pregpt#18%2C36-18%2C36) script and then use it at line 44 to append the remote name to the [.gitmeta](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/.gitmeta#1%2C1-1%2C1) file. Here's how to do it:

Define the variable at line 9:
```shell:pre-commit
9|first_remote_name=$(git remote | head -n 1)
```

Then, use this variable at line 44:
```shell:pre-commit
44|echo "Remote Name: $first_remote_name" >> .gitmeta
```Performing edit... done!









Based on the @Ethereal documentation:
About line 54, I want to replace geth by ethereal for signing a message then getting the signed message.

Then, storing the signed message on .gitmeta.
Remember: that signed message is the commit_cid variable.





To replace the [geth](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#54%2C17-54%2C17) command with [ethereal](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/Tasks.txt#1%2C65-1%2C65) for signing a message and storing the signed message in [.gitmeta](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/.gitmeta#1%2C1-1%2C1), you can modify the existing code in the [pre-commit](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#21%2C36-21%2C36) script as follows:

Replace the [geth](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#54%2C17-54%2C17) command with [ethereal](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/Tasks.txt#1%2C65-1%2C65) for signing the commit CID:
```shell:pre-commit
54|signature=$(ethereal signature sign "$commit_cid" "$eth_account" null)
```

Store the signed message in `.gitmeta`:
```shell:pre-commit
55|echo "Signature: $signature" >> .gitmeta
```

Based on the Ethereal documentation, to sign a message using Ethereal and store the signed message in [.gitmeta](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/.gitmeta#1%2C1-1%2C1), you can replace [geth](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit.pregpt#49%2C17-49%2C17) with [ethereal](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#54%2C17-54%2C17) for signing the commit CID and store the signature in [.gitmeta](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/.gitmeta#1%2C1-1%2C1). 

Replace the [geth](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit.pregpt#49%2C17-49%2C17) command with [ethereal](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#54%2C17-54%2C17) for signing the commit CID:
```shell:pre-commit
54|signature=$(ethereal signature sign "$commit_cid" "$eth_account" null)
```

Store the signed message in `.gitmeta`:
```shell:pre-commit
55|echo "Signature: $signature" >> .gitmeta
```









But ethereal itself clearly said:
"no passphrase or private key; cannot sign"
How to, instead of placing the private key, it calls geth's keyking to be unlocked via password?

Also, you forgot "--data" is required before the message to be signed.

Please re-read @Ethereal 's Documentation.








Based on the Ethereal documentation, to sign a message using Ethereal and unlock the account via a passphrase with `ethereal signature sign`, you need to include the `--data` flag before the message to be signed. Additionally, you cannot sign without providing a passphrase or private key. To address this, you can use `ethereal` to sign the message and unlock the account via a passphrase using `geth`'s keyring. Here's how you can modify the code:

Include the `--data` flag and adjust the signing command to use `geth`'s keyring for unlocking via passphrase:
```shell:pre-commit
54|signature=$(ethereal signature sign --data="$commit_cid" --passphrase="your_passphrase_here")
```









ethereal signature sign --nohash --data "QmdXKH62WGugG6ohvseWjTodkJohymumTWsepUF7NksbZ1" --signer=0xDDfC2e10702d8A781727A34D83B3bb3CA94a3E91

Obviously replacing "QmdXKH62WGugG6ohvseWjTodkJohymumTWsepUF7NksbZ1" by "$commit_cid" and 0xDDfC2e10702d8A781727A34D83B3bb3CA94a3E91 by $eth_account.

Before echo "Signature: $signature" >> .gitmeta, please add echo "Signed-off by: $eth_account" >> .gitmeta

Before storing the signature in `.gitmeta`, add the line to include the signer's information:
```shell:pre-commit
55|echo "Signed-off by: $eth_account" >> .gitmeta
```
