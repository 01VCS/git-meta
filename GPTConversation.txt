I don't want this git hook to run its functions if the tree has nothing staged!
I don't want useless commits containing just .gitmeta/.gitmeta-cid (which is currently happening).




To prevent the [pre-commit](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/to-merge/git-meta.pl#503%2C30-503%2C30) hook from running its functions when there are no staged changes, you can check if the [staged_files](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#16%2C1-16%2C1) variable is empty before proceeding with the rest of the script. If [staged_files](file:///media/daniella/B/git/nerdy%20DAOs/01VCS/git-meta/pre-commit#16%2C1-16%2C1) is empty, you can exit the script early. Here's how you can modify the relevant lines:


```14:14:pre-commit
#!/bin/bash

#01VCSHere

echo "Storing files' timestamp, CID/hash; and other files/commit's metadata..."

commit_author="$(git config user.name)"" <""$(git config user.email)"">" 
commit_message=$(cat $1)
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) #from https://dev.to/anibalardid/how-to-check-commit-message-and-branch-name-with-git-hooks-without-any-new-installation-n34
# https://github.com/typicode/husky/discussions/1171

if [ ! -f ".gitmeta-cid" ]; then touch .gitmeta-cid; fi

echo "Branch: $current_branch" > .gitmeta-cid & #use ">" instead of ">>" as a way of emptying .gitmeta-cid before writing new commit data
# Get a list of all staged files
staged_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
# Hash (IPFS CID) the contents of each staged file, to the pipe
for file in $staged_files; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        file_cid=$(ipfs add -q --only-hash "$file")
        echo "$file"": ""$file_cid" >> .gitmeta-cid &
    fi
done
```

Add a check right after obtaining the list of staged files:
```bash
# Get a list of all staged files
staged_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

# Exit if no files are staged
if [ -z "$staged_files" ]; then
    echo "No files staged. Exiting pre-commit hook."
    exit 0
fi
```
This modification ensures that if there are no files staged for commit, the script prints a message and exits early, avoiding the creation of commits containing only `.gitmeta` or `.gitmeta-cid` when there are no actual changes.
