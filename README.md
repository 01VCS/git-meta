# git-meta

Wanna git preserve your file dates?

git-meta stores all files' metadata into '.gitmeta'! On every commit!

Based on a gist: https://gist.github.com/andris9/1978266
Also includes this fork gist: https://gist.github.com/Cojad/9205547/revisions

**Update 20/10/2023**: in the 1st place: don't worry, you can still install git-meta standalone as you used to. In the 2nd place: git-meta now's part of a bigger project: [01](https://github.com/01VCS/01), a VCS layer2/aggregator. By installing 01, you're installing git-meta ready to come built-in every time you create an new repo!

## Instructions

### Initializing

Copy git-meta.sh and init.sh into your repo, then type the following command:

```bash
bash init.sh
```

And done, it will be initiated!

### Updating

Copy an up-to-date version of git-meta.sh and update.sh into your repo, then type the following command:

```bash
bash update.sh
```

Done!
